# Bible Study Companion: A Modern Bible App Created for You

Visit & use the app here: https://bibleresearch.vercel.app

## Why another Bible app?

We like other Bible apps, but they won't fit as good as our own Bible app would. See below some of the features we would like our Bible app to have:

## List of Planned Features
### 🗒️🫂 Shareable Public Notes
#### What is it?

A platform where users can share their Bible notes or collections with specific verses and commentary.

#### Why it matters:

Enhances evangelism and mentoring by allowing users to share specific verses with others while providing access to complete chapters for context.

#### Current state:
🟢 Implemented in API. See shared notes example filtered by a user defined tag: https://bibleresearchapi.vercel.app/api/v1/notes/?tag_id=TAGA2BE0AE324014D5

🟠 Still has to be implemented on Front-end side
<br>
<br>
### 🔈🔁 Audio Loop Feature
#### What is it?
The ability to select specific verses and listen to them repeatedly.

#### Why it matters:
Useful for verse memorization (e.g. while driving a car).

#### Current state:
🟢 Current version supports audio Bible via UI. See it [here](https://bibleresearch.vercel.app)

🟠 Work still has to be done on Front-end side and slightly on Back-end
<br>
<br>
### 🔍 Advanced Search Capabilities
#### What is it?
- Exclude specific keywords from search results
- Support for exact text matching, approximate matching, and semantic search (e.g., searching for "fire" would also return results containing "flame")

#### Why it matters:
Research specific words or topic in Bible a lot easier.

#### Current state:
🟢 Current version supports search feature via UI. See it [here](https://bibleresearch.vercel.app)

🟠 Work still has to be done on Front-end and Back-end side.

<br>
### 💬 Community Discussion Features
#### What is it?
Spaces for both public and private group discussions about scripture. Public notes are visible to everyone with commenting options, while private notes can be restricted to specific groups or individuals.

#### Why it matters:
- Centers conversations around scripture
- Allows users to easily access community commentary while reading the Bible

#### Current state:
🔴 Not started.
<br>
<br>
### 📓 Exportable Notes
#### What is it?
Functionality to export all personal notes to external formats.

#### Why it matters:
Provides freedom and flexibility by allowing users to continue their Bible study using other tools (such as Excel or Word).

#### Current state:
🟢 As seen in shareable notes [example](https://bibleresearchapi.vercel.app/api/v1/notes/?tag_id=TAGA2BE0AE324014D5) users can access their notes in a JSON format which enables developers to export their notes.

🟠 Support non-tech users to export their notes to other platforms, Google Sheets for example.
<br>
<br>
### 💻📱 Cross-Platform Access
#### What is it?
Seamless availability of notes across mobile and desktop devices.

#### Why it matters:
Many users prefer conducting in-depth Bible research on desktop platforms, a feature not universally supported by existing Bible apps.
